    "## Introduction\n",
    "Most of us are very familiar with the structure of relational databases and how to model data for it. However schemas developed for relational databases tend to become complicated and resistant to change. In addition as more tables are added to a schema the joins required for both reads and writes become more complicated which slows down database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution to this problem is the use of document store databases, such as DynamoDB. These databases tend to be schemaless making it easier to change the data stored as requirements evolve. In addition a common principal of many of these databases is that you should be able to get all the information you require in a single read operation which often requires you to carefully consider the indexes you create and denormalise your data to model relationships. While denormalising data does make reading easier it does create difficulty in ensuring consistency during write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general relational databases, as their names suggest, are good at modelling the relationships between different pieces of data and performing adhoc queries although the complexity of these relationship increases the length of time these operation take. Document store databases on the other hand tend to be very fast to find individual documents but the modelling of relationship is an acquired skill that becomes increasingly complicated as the types of relationships increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This all struck me as a little like the Goldilocks principal, one is too hot and the other too cold, so where is the \"just right\" solution? So I decide to have a look at graph databases to see if they might be a better solution.\n"

    "## Context\n",
    "For the purposes of this discussion we will be considering how to implement a database to hold data about computing devices that are located at a particular location and can be owned and managed by different organisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be stated from the outset that this is not really a complicated or large domain, in fact you could probably store all the data in a csv file and still get acceptable performance, but it will allow us to identify some of the features of graph databases that are useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "As always with development knowing the requirements we are trying to meet is essential. Listed below are some of the requirements that I have identified for this domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be able to find an individual device.\n",
    "2. Be able to find all devices at a given location.\n",
    "3. Find all devices for the sites associated with an organisation.\n",
    "4. Be able to find all devices with a particular status.\n",
    "5. Find all devices of a particular type."

    "## The Database\n",
    "For the examples in this notebook we will be using Neo4j. You can download the Neo4j desktop application from their [website](https://neo4j.com/download-center/). This application will allow you to create a local database to try things out. There is a AWS graph database service available, called Neptune, but as there doesn't seem to be any free tier available on the service it was decided not to use that at this stage. All code examples in this document are in Python. However Neo4j itself is a Java application and client libraries are available in a number of different languages, including Javascript.\n",
